# Logic Design

- Clear display
- Method: Asking for name
- Method: Get ship placement
- Method: Determine if valid spot for ship
- Storing ship information: Array per user => because it will not change its length
- Storing shot information: Array per user => because it will not change its length
- Method: Create a grid for each user
- Method: Print out grid
- Method: Fire on opponent
- Method: Determine if a shot can be taken & outcome
- Method: Display score

* Method: Print winner and shots taken
