# WOULD Framework

1. Walk through the project
   - General understanding of the app
2. Open up the requirements
   - What are the true requirements? List what was given and start asking questions
   - Ex: what platform must it run on;
3. User interface design
   - Draw it out by hand to iterate fast and painless
4. Logic design
   - Design big picture of modules and interactions.
   - Ex: Do I need a database? How does the data travel through the app, etc
5. Data Design
   - What the models look like?
   - Ex: Can there be 2 addresses for the same person? what about phone numbers
